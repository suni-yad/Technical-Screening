3. Modify the Measurement class to have a name, return the weighted averages grouped by each measurement name as Map<String, double>.
Example:
[
Measurement("speed", 1,2)
Measurement("speed", 3,4)
Measurement("fuel", 5,6)
Measurement("fuel", 7,8)
]
=
Map(
"speed" -> 2.3333
"fuel" -> 6.14
)
    
1.Scaffold out an object representing a measurement.  A measurement contains the following information: A value representing the value of the measurement and a value representing the weight of the measurement. 
2. Create class with a main method and a method called "calculateWeightedAverage".  This method takes in a list of Measurement and returns the weighted average of all the measurement values.  (Note: negative weights are not allowed and should be thrown out)
A weighted average is calculated as follows.  SUM(value * weight)/SUM(weight).  Example: ((10 * 2) + (50 * 5) + (40 * 3)) / (2 + 5 + 3) = 390/10 = 39.
